# pydlearn

## py(thon)d(eep)learn(ing) library

pydlearn takes a lot of inspiration from github.com/geohot/tinygrad, but is written from scratch with a focus on trying to further simplify the codebase without enforcing any arbitrary line of code limits.

Devices are external to the library, if you want to use the gpu make sure to install pyopencl
